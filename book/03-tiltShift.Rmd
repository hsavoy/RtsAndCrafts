# Mimicking Tilt-Shift Photography  {#tiltShift}

## Intro


## Packages being used

```{r message=FALSE}

```

### Step 1: Read in the image

This will work best if the images we are manipulating have objects near the middle of the image to which we can draw the audience's attention.

```{r }
   
```

### Step 2: Define the focal area

Basically, we will specify the range of coordinates we want as the focal area (the locator function is handy here!). For simplicity, I'll draw a box over the object in the center of the image:

### Step 3: Apply the blurring filter

We will have a variable amount of blur: highest near the image borders and decreasing to zero as it approaches the focal area.

### Step 4: Modifying the color saturation


Any edge detection?
